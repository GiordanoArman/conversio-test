# Small test project

Hello Conversio staff, first of all thanks for the chance you are giving me.

I organised the codebase as a starting point for a library, it is an npm 
package I developed on Node.js v10.12.0. The `index.js` file exposes the 
deepFlatten function, which is the piece of code that performs the task
that was asked of me.

To install the test library (jest) enter the project from command line and 
type `npm i`, then to run the tests suite simply run `npm test`.
